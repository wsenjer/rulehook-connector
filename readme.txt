Connect your WooCommerce store to RuleHook ‚Äî a powerful rules engine for dynamic shipping rates.

== Description ==

**RuleHook Connector** seamlessly integrates WooCommerce with [RuleHook](https://rulehook.com), a SaaS platform that gives you precise control over shipping logic.

Out of the box, WooCommerce shipping rules are limited. With RuleHook, you can define **unlimited conditions and actions** to tailor shipping methods to your exact business needs.

Examples of what you can do:
‚Äì Offer *Free Shipping* for orders over $100 **except** bulky items.
‚Äì Apply different rates based on *weight brackets, volume, or dimensions*.
‚Äì Restrict certain methods for specific *countries, states, or zip codes*.
‚Äì Add handling fees or surcharges dynamically.
‚Äì Show or hide methods depending on *user role, product category, or cart contents*.

If WooCommerce shipping zones frustrate you, RuleHook Connector unlocks the flexibility you need ‚Äî without hacks or bloated plugins.

== Features ==

‚Äì Full integration with RuleHook SaaS.
‚Äì Unlimited shipping rules with AND/OR logic.
‚Äì Supports weight, subtotal, dimensions, quantity, product tags, categories, attributes, user roles, locations, and more.
‚Äì Fine-grained control: show, hide, rename, or adjust shipping methods dynamically.
‚Äì Fast evaluation engine built for scale.
‚Äì Works with existing WooCommerce shipping zones.

== Integration & Source Code ==

This plugin connects your WooCommerce store to the RuleHook platform (https://rulehook.com), a service that provides dynamic shipping rate logic based on custom conditions and rules.

When connected, the plugin communicates with the RuleHook API to:
- Authenticate your WooCommerce store.
- Sync shipping zones, shipping methods, and order/cart data when evaluating rules.
- Retrieve calculated shipping rates that match your configured rules on the RuleHook dashboard.

**Data Sent**

The plugin may send the following data to the RuleHook API during operation:
- Store URL and store name (for identification)
- Shipping zones, methods, and related settings
- Destination country, state, postcode, and cart details (for rate calculation)
- API credentials generated during the ‚ÄúAuthorize This Site‚Äù process

No customer personal data (such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers) is transmitted.

**Purpose**

This data exchange is required for the plugin to calculate and display dynamic shipping rates in WooCommerce based on your rules defined in RuleHook.

**Service Provider**

The external service is provided by **RuleHook**
