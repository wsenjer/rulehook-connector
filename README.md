Powerful rule-based shipping for WooCommerce. Set flexible rates by weight, cart value, location, products, and more.

== Description ==

**RuleHook Connector** seamlessly integrates WooCommerce with [RuleHook](https://rulehook.com), a SaaS platform that gives you precise control over shipping logic.

Out of the box, WooCommerce shipping rules are limited. With RuleHook, you can define **unlimited conditions and actions** to tailor shipping methods to your exact business needs.

Examples of what you can do:
â€“ Offer *Free Shipping* for orders over $100 **except** bulky items.
â€“ Apply different rates based on *weight brackets, volume, or dimensions*.
â€“ Restrict certain methods for specific *countries, states, or zip codes*.
â€“ Add handling fees or surcharges dynamically.
â€“ Show or hide methods depending on *user role, product category, or cart contents*.

If WooCommerce shipping zones frustrate you, RuleHook Connector unlocks the flexibility you need â€” without hacks or bloated plugins.

== Features ==

â€“ Full integration with RuleHook SaaS.
â€“ Unlimited shipping rules with AND/OR logic.
â€“ Supports weight, subtotal, dimensions, quantity, product tags, categories, attributes, user roles, locations, and more.
â€“ Fine-grained control: show, hide, rename, or adjust shipping methods dynamically.
â€“ Fast evaluation engine built for scale.
â€“ Works with existing WooCommerce shipping zones.
