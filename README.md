Connect your WooCommerce store to **RuleHook** ‚Äî a powerful rules engine for dynamic shipping rates.

---

## üß© Description

**RuleHook Connector** seamlessly integrates WooCommerce with [RuleHook](https://rulehook.com), a SaaS platform that gives you precise control over shipping logic.

Out of the box, WooCommerce shipping rules are limited. With RuleHook, you can define **unlimited conditions and actions** to tailor shipping methods to your exact business needs.

### Example Use Cases
- Offer *Free Shipping* for orders over $100 **except** bulky items.
- Apply different rates based on *weight brackets, volume, or dimensions*.
- Restrict certain methods for specific *countries, states, or zip codes*.
- Add handling fees or surcharges dynamically.
- Show or hide methods depending on *user role, product category, or cart contents*.

If WooCommerce shipping zones frustrate you, RuleHook Connector unlocks the flexibility you need ‚Äî without hacks or bloated plugins.
